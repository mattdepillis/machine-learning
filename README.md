# Overview

This repository serves as the central info dump for code related to my self-learning of AI/ML as a discipline. Over time, I will fill it with example practice problems, course learnings, small personal projects, and more. I hope for it to become not only a personal progress tracker throughout my learnings of ML systems, but a source of inspiration for myself as well.

Target state structure of this repo:
- ```/libraries```, which will house practice problems aimed at competency/mastery of fundamental ML libraries for Python, such as NumPy, Pandas, and TensorFlow/PyTorch.
- ```/courses```, aimed at tracking progress of sample practice problems, code snippets, and open-ended questions provided by specific learning courses or books.
- ```/problems```, aimed at housing solutions and dialogue related to ad-hoc problem prompts I find along my learning journey, and
- ```/projects```, under which will be located smaller personal projects unworthy of a standalone github repo that task me with exploring a specific prompt.
